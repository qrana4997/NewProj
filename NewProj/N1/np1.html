    <p> I chose Shaun of the Dead as my favorite film. The reason for this is that the Director Edgar Wright was denied from every major film school in the U.K. Instead, he used the money he would've spent on tuition creating the film. This film is much more than a story about zombies. It is an example of a real-life mind that didnt stop, regardless of not having the traditional tools to succeed. It's proof that if you believe enough in your product and market it through all the right mediums, success is bound to find you. </p></centered>
    <p> My second favorite film is Django Unchained. It tells a beautifully diverse story. And lastly, The Wolf of Wallstreet. I'm a fan of the cast and large budget productions. I'm currently an intern for Harbor Picture Company, who've had a hand in creating 2 of the 3 films on this list. Harbor is owned by Publicis Groupe, one of the Big 4 globally in advertising. </p></centered>
